# chess
(Toy app) Play chess against a friend. 

Base application for pratice Ruby and game_based logic applications.

At your turn you can insert your move using international notation, and if the move is correct, we produce as output an 8x8 array with piece position.
Also, it will determine the end-game condition: Mate or stalemate. We will try to add move repetition (it needs database and indexing).
